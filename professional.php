During my summer breaks in 2007, 2008 and 2009, I interned as a junior programmer at <a href="http://www.viciouscycleinc.com/">Vicious Cycle Software</a> in Morrisville, NC.
I worked primarily on graphics features for the <a href="http://www.viciousengine.com/">Vicious Engine</a>, such as lighting research, improving the shader graph
editor, rapid UV atlasing for game levels, and automatic LOD generation. I also worked on productivity features for the editor, such as implementing 3ds Max-style transform gizmos,
creating tools for locating memory and performance problems, and creating an improved selection dialog to make level designers' lives easier.
</p>
<p>
Many of the editor and engine improvements I worked on were used in <a href="http://eatleadvideogame.com/">Eat Lead</a>, which was released in February of 2009
for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.
